## Description
As I'm finishing up my fullstack coding boot camp through the University of Utah I wanted to showcase and test my skills with building a react portfolio. This will have a small professional about me section, a resume that you can download, 6 of my most recent projects, and a contact form! The contact form is not full functional yet but you can find my email below for now!
